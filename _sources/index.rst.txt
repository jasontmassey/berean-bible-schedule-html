Berean Bible Schedule
=====================

The Bereans received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures
daily (Acts 17:11).

Jesus said, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes
from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).

All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be
complete, equipped for every good work (2 Timothy 3:16).

For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that
through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have
hope (Romans 15:4).
