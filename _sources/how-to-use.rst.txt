How to Use
==========

The Berean Bible Schedule was originally created to be a 1-year plan.  However,
by changing how you approach the schedule, you can easily convert it into a
2-year, 3-year, or 4-year reading plan.

There are 365 readings in the schedule, each containing three sections:

* Old Testament ("OT"),
* New Testament ("NT"), and
* Inspirational (Psalms and Proverbs).


As a 1-year plan
----------------

As a 1-year plan, you can use the schedule "by date" or "by day number"
depending on whether you start on January 1st or some other day.

**By date:** start the schedule on January 1st, completing all the sections for each day (OT, NT, Inspirational), then continue until December 31st.


**By day number:** start the schedule on any arbitrary day with reading number ``001``, completing all the sections for each day (OT, NT, Inspirational), then continue until reading number ``365``.


As a 2-year plan
----------------

* Aim to complete a reading every two days.

* Start the schedule with reading number ``001``.

* Read the OT section on day one.

* Read the NT and Inspirational sections on day two.

* Repeat until you complete reading number ``365``.


As a 3-year plan
----------------

* Aim to complete a reading every three days.

* Start the schedule with reading number ``001``.

* Read the OT section on day one.

* Read the NT section on day two.
  
* Read the Inspirational section on day three.

* Repeat until you complete reading number ``365``.


As a 4-year plan
----------------

* Aim to complete a reading every four days.

* Start the schedule with reading number ``001``.

* Read the OT section on day one.

* Read the NT section on day two.
  
* Read the Psalm(s) from the Inspirational section on day three.

* Read the Proverb(s) from the Inspirational section on day four.

* Repeat until you complete reading number ``365``.
