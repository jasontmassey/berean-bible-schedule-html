The Berean Bible Schedule was created by Jason Massey in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Originally created in the 1990s,
the schedule was a 26-page printed booklet (US letter-sized sheets, 8.5in x 5.5in pages).
For years, Jason used it for personal Bible-reading,
and gave the booklets away to whomever was interested.

In February 2023, Jason decided to migrate the schedule to the Web,
which prompted the creation of this site,
the content of which was constructed from screenshots of the original booklet.
Jason also intends to update the printed booklet,
then make it available for download in PDF format for all who wish to
print/create their own.
